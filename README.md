# GAN-BERT
In this project we aim to implement a Deep Neural Network based on GAN-BERT model for text classification purposes using semi-supervised learning, so the model can detect the type of the large language model(LLM) that generated the text. 
This project is consisted of 4 main parts:  
In the first part, BERT is fune-tuned using 1,5,50, and 100 percent of labeled dataset and the obtained accuracies are compared to each other. 
Second, the model is modified so that we have a more robust and efficient training process.
Third, GAN-BERT model is implemented and accuracy of the final model with partial labeled dataset is compared to the first part. 
Finally, the model is modified(GAN part in specific), so that we achieve higher accuracy on test set.
